# SMBC Comic Fulltext Search

This leverages my [other repository](https://github.com/sambhavsaggi/comic-ocr) to create a frontend to search for text in [SMBC comics](https://www.smbc-comics.com).

## Why tho

There are times when I remember the perfect SMBC to send to someone, but I cannot find it! So I created this tool to help me out.

## How well does it work?

It works well enough. The OCR isn't the best (esp since the font isn't very strict), but I found what I needed to find easily enough.

Hope Zach doesn't get too mad I scraped his website (sorry)

Search is done in the frontend because my server is down right now. I used [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io) to do the actual search.

PRs are welcome if they really help. I don't wanna bother with minor cosmetic change since I am by no means a frontend dev.

THIS IS IN NO WAY ENDORSED OR SUPPORTED BY SMBC. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

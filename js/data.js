if nothing is scarce, what is scarce?\u201d             \u201cthe post-scarcity society,\u201d she ventured.             \u201cnow, the point here is this - the study of economics is the study of a moving target. it began is the study of how to allocate a few very rare things. then it became the study of how to allocate a few moderately rare things. with the advent of cold fusion 30 years ago, it reached what can be considered an infection point.\u201d             she wrote this down. he appreciated this, and it moved him to go on.             \u201cindeed. these would have been hominids too simple to make use of the laws of thermodynamics to resolve turned disputes, much less the laws of relatively.\u201d             \u201chow primitive,\u201d she said.             \u201cof course that is lost to history in its particulars,\u201d he said. \u201chowever, there is reason to believe that it was resolved through the application of newton\u2019s second law, as embodied in a fist.\u201d             \u201chow was it resolved?\u201d             \u201cprior to that, it was extremely scarce resources.\u201d at this point, he located a drawing of the descent of man. this drawing was unusual, in that at each vol- binary stage, the hominids were arguing with each other over something in the middle of them. \u201cin fact,\u201d he said, handing the image to her, economics can be traced all the way back to a particular march in 1,332,014 b.c. during which a group of happens in sub-saharan africa had to dirty up a turned. at that time, co- notice was defined as the study of the allocation of this one turned.\u201d             she nodded.             \u201chowever.\u201d he continued, searching through the papers on his desk for a particular one, \u201cthat is only a recent definition. in the past, economics has been the study of the allocation of very scarce resources.\u201d             the fat woman nodded.                \u201ceconomic:      said the fat man, \u201cis the study of the allocation of scarce resource          \u201cscarcity\u201d ", "bonus": "  ", "alt": "2012-12-24"}, {"title": "2013-04-08", "comic": "      your kid re-enacted the battle of hastings             ", "bonus": "/taxation /s canceled    ", "alt": "2013-04-08"}, {"title": "sports", "comic": "            of god. not yet. you have to last longer the 30 seconds. \ufb01  it's mot worrkvg/ more boring: soccer/            more boring/ -baseball! baseaaul!
